This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `Constants.deviceId` to access the device's unique identifier, but the identifier isn't available yet, particularly in the early stages of app initialization.  This can manifest as undefined or null in certain situations. For example:

```javascript
import * as Constants from 'expo-constants';

console.log(Constants.deviceId); // Might log undefined or null
```
