To reliably access the device ID, use an asynchronous approach, for example, within a `useEffect` hook (for functional components) or similar lifecycle methods (for class components). Here's a corrected example using `useEffect`:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import * as Constants from 'expo-constants';

function MyComponent() {
  const [deviceId, setDeviceId] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchDeviceId = async () => {
      setDeviceId(Constants.deviceId);
    };
    fetchDeviceId();
  }, []);

  if (deviceId === null) {
    return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  } else {
    return (
      <Text>Device ID: {deviceId}</Text>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This solution uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch the `deviceId` once the component has mounted and the device ID is more likely to be available.  The `useState` hook handles the loading state, and displays a 'Loading...' message until the ID is fetched.  Always handle the possibility that the device ID may still be unavailable, even with this solution.
