# Expo Constants.deviceId returns undefined or null

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using `Constants.deviceId` in Expo applications.  The problem is that `Constants.deviceId` might return `undefined` or `null` during the initial stages of application loading, before the device ID is fully resolved. This can lead to unexpected app behavior or crashes.

## Problem

The core issue is that the device ID is not immediately available upon app startup.  Attempting to access `Constants.deviceId` too early may result in undefined or null.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that you only access `Constants.deviceId` after the device ID has been properly determined and populated by Expo. This can often be achieved using asynchronous operations such as `useEffect` in functional components or lifecycle methods in class components.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the project using Expo Go or by building the app for your target platform. Observe the console logs and note the timing of the device ID retrieval.
